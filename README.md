# Hangman
Recreating the classic game of hangman using python. 
My game will have two players to start with, however I can incorporate random word generator to play against computer and different levels later.
The first player will input the word that player 2 will have to guess. If player 2 guesses a letter which is not included then part of the hangman picture will be drawn. When the full pricture is drawn that is when player 2 loses.

My first version of the game will be lives instead and I will focus on the drawing of the picture afterwards.
